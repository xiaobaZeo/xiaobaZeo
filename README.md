# Helloï¼ŒI'm Zeo. ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I focus on full-stack development and am passionate about turning ideas into feasible technical solutions. I have previously participated in a mini-program project with over 20,000 daily active users, where I built the project from scratch and was responsible for the development of several key modules.

## Project Experience

### webCampus
I was fully involved in and responsible for both the frontend and backend development of the WeChat mini-program. The project included multiple business modules, such as user authentication, a second-hand marketplace, and forum topic publishing.

## Educational Experience
My major is Computer Science and Technology, and during my time at university, I combined theoretical knowledge with practical project experience. This mini-program project has given me a deep understanding of all aspects of system development, from requirement analysis to online operation and maintenance, providing me with valuable experience.
